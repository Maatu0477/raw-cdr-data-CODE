CDR Analysis with Insights is a project basd on Data Analytis where we are given a platform to work with the client on real world dataset.

We need to visualize the Analytics for Call Data, Device Data and Service Data and need to develop a POC for one of itsesteemed clients for Unified Cll Daata Record Analysis

This work requires us to do Data Prparation and required us to find Data insights from raw CDR data provided to us by the client; including Data Cleaning and need to show important informations like the cards, pie chart, tabular data, etc.

This is an emerging and a growing field.
